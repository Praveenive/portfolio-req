           <h1> Interview App</h1>  built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) 
            can have the following tech stack components:

<h1>Frontend (Client-side):</h1>

<h4>React:</h4> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create dynamic and responsive UI components.
<h4>React Router:</h4> A library for handling client-side routing in a React application, enabling the creation of multi-page experiences within a single-page app.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend to the backend.
<h1>Backend (Server-side):</h1>

<h4>Node.js:</h4> A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side.
Express.js: A minimalistic web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
<h4>MongoDB:</h4> A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. MongoDB is often used for applications that require dynamic and scalable data storage.
<h4>Mongoose:</h4> An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with MongoDB and helps with data validation and modeling.
Authentication and Authorization:

<h4>JSON Web Tokens (JWT):</h4> A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. JWTs are commonly used for implementing user authentication and authorization.
Passport.js: A popular authentication middleware for Node.js that supports various authentication strategies, including JWT.
API and Server Management:

<h4>RESTful APIs:</h4> The backend can expose RESTful endpoints that the frontend can communicate with to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Interview data.
<h4>Middleware:</h4> Express.js middleware can be used for tasks like authentication, request validation, error handling, etc.
Other Tools and Libraries:

<h4>Webpack:</h4> A module bundler that helps package the frontend code and assets.
Babel: A transpiler that converts modern JavaScript code into an older version that's compatible with most browsers.
Nodemon: A development tool that automatically restarts the Node.js server when changes are detected in the codebase.
<h4>Postman :</h4> API testing tools that help you test your APIs during development.
Deployment and Hosting:

<h4> Netlify, or Vercel:</h4> Platforms that provide easy deployment for both the frontend and backend parts of your application.
<h4>MongoDB Atlas:</h4> A cloud-based database service that offers managed MongoDB instances.
Remember that this is a general overview of the tech stack components for a MERN-based Interview application. The specific tools and libraries you choose might vary based on your project's requirements and your team's familiarity with certain technologies.
